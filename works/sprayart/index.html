                <p class="article__txt"><span class="article__evident">Q:</span> Mr. Yefremov, when did you first make the decision to organize this exhibit? What influenced your decision to organize an art exhibit entitled Superheroes and the 45th US President and combining, what at first glance cannot be combined—the 45th future President of the United States and Superheroes, which theoretically have nothing in common</p>
                
                
                <p class="article__txt"><span class="article__evident">Mr. Yefremov:</span> The idea of this exhibit occurred spontaneously. I made the decision to organize this exhibit during the debates at the end of April, when it became clear to me there would be two candidates for President, Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. It was then that I decided to make a contribution to the victory of Hilary Clinton during the Presidential elections and began implementing and financing the art project, and preparing for the exhibit. For the realization of the project, I invited several artists. I wanted to create interest in the exhibit not only in the older generations, which as a rule, are more interested in elections, but also the younger generation, to spark in them an interest towards political events, which will invariably affect their future. For that, I had the idea to combine the classic portrait painting with Superheroes, portrayed in the ways in which we always see them, but depicting the 45th President of the US and various world leaders in the image of Superheroes. <br>
                Moreover, the exhibit will also feature an exhibit of our pets - cats and dogs in the appearance of Superheroes, which I am sure, will raise interest in lovers of politics as well as the average person. The decision of how the Superheroes for world leaders will be portrayed was made by me. It is possible that for some, the choice of leaders and their Superhero counterparts will not pleasing deep down in their soul, but as the saying goes in Russian: “as many people, as many as opinions”. It is my personal opinion which I realized in this exhibit, many can disagree with it and I am prepared to discuss with them further this topic, and as it is well known “it is in debate that interest is born”.

                <p class="article__txt"><span class="article__evident">Q:</span> Which party do you prefer: Democrat or Republican? Are you a Democrat or a Republican?</p>
                
                <p class="article__txt"><span class="article__evident">Yefremov:</span> To begin with, according to my beliefs, I am Republican and always gave the Republican Party my support. In the future I will probably stay a Republican, but in the current historical moment, I have made the decision to support Hilary Clinton for the post of President of the United States. I don't doubt for a minute that she is the next President as the alternative at this moment is not a realistic possibility. The country is going through tough times. We need huge economic reforms, solutions to immigration issues, the return of our soldiers from Afghanistan and Iraq, an unyielding war on terrorism in conjunction with other regional countries and partners with respect to state sovereignty, and a revival of the former respect for the United States worldwide. In my opinion, the only person who could deal with all that currently is Hilary Clinton. <br>
                 Secondly, Hilary Clinton is a lawyer. She has the legal work experience, the political experience as Senator of New York, the international experience as US Secretary, as well as Oval Office experience as First Lady for 8 years. She has the experience of solving world problems and meeting eye to eye with world leaders and her experience is much needed for the country right now. <br>
                Thirdly, in voting for Hilary Clinton, the country will have a respected and experienced politician as a priceless private counsel to the 45th President in the form of the 42nd President, Bill Clinton, under whose watch the economy of the country was prospering and the US had prestige and respect worldwide. <br>
                For me, it's also no small feat that during challenging times for the Clintons, Hilary proved courageous in her role as First Lady, able to withstand these hardships with dignity. Her behavior elicits in me a great respect and support. Family, that is essentially government. If the government does not attempt to preserve the family, does not respect its children and the elderly, then than government has no future.

                <p class="article__txt"><span class="article__evident">Q: </span> How will the <span class="article__italic">Superheroes and the 45th US President</span> exhibit be organized? </p>
                
                <p class="article__txt"><span class="article__evident">Yefremov:</span> This exhibit will have a new format. The opening of the exhibit is planned for September 15 in New York and the final closing for November 6, with a tour of no less than 39 states. To accomplish this, there will be organized 4 art groups which will simultaneously lead exhibits in various states. Ideally, the exhibit would be shown throughout the US, run by 6-8 groups, as our goal isn't only to have one exhibit in one specific state, but to organize and showcase Superheroes and the 45th US President in over 100 US cities with over 200,000 residents, for the exhibit to not only reach the major cities, but cities with smaller populations as well. Without question, the success of the project will depend not only on our leadership, but on our volunteers and sponsors, which will provide their own contributions and who also have a large stake at this momentous election. <br>
                Art Event Group Inc. will also be releasing publications on the 45th US President. The release of a book is scheduled to take place November-December of 2016. Art calendar by Ivanna Urban will also be released, dedicated to the 45th US President, Hilary Clinton. Moreover, another exhibit will take place, honoring the 100 first days of the 45th President, to be viewed in two cities: New York and Washington DC in May 2017.

                <p class="article__txt"><span class="article__evident">Q:</span> Is the Democratic Party or Hilary Clinton funding or supporting this project?</p>
                
                
                <p class="article__txt"><span class="article__evident">Yefremov:</span> The whole idea of the project is attributable solely to me.  The organization as well as reaching out to artists was done solely by me, without even the knowledge of my closest friends.  Any information on the project was only published on the site on July 26, 2016.  Neither the Democratic Party nor any Hilary Clinton staff had any prior knowledge. I will make the formal invitation to staff via email after the Democratic Convention which will take place July 25-28 in Philadelphia. <br>
                As President of Art Event Group Inc. and organizer of the project, I am asking leaders in the organization, sponsors and volunteers to make their contribution in the organization of the project and get the word out to reach residents of the US during this historical moment. <br> 
                To receive further updates on the project, follow updates our site. We invite everyone throughout the States to visit our exhibits, follow the project, and get the word out.
