                    <p>Updated May 18, 2015 March 24, 2015 - The <a href="#">Green Coffee Bean Extract</a> is the latest buzz in the "battle of the bulge". Since recently being studied on a popular doctor television show, millions of people are praising this so called "miracle weight loss pill". Surprisingly, many people who struggle daily with their weight have yet to hear about this powerful supplement.</p>
                      
                      <p>I am a true skeptic about all weight loss supplements. Since seeing on Dr. Oz, I have read numerous reviews and compared many of the green coffee bean extract brands. When I read this one so pure and real, I was sold, but still skeptical. I received my order in a matter of a few days,even before the estimated delivery dates and began taking it immediately. I was so impressed that my hunger was curbed and being caffeine sensitive, I didn't feel the least bit jittery! I am seeing great results and have ordered 2 more bottles. This is a mainstay for me!</p>

          <h3>Health Benefits of Green Coffee Bean Extract</h3>
        <h5>There are Many!</h5>
        </hgroup>  <!-- end hgroup -->

        <article class="col-xs-12">
            <p>Chlorogenic acid, the key component of green coffee bean extract, is a powerful natural anitoxidant which combats free radicals in the blood stream. The affect is to slow down the aging process, and improve circulation and muscle tone.</p>

<p>The major anti-oxidant in green coffee bean extract, chlorogenic acid, inhibits the release of the G6P enzyme which has been shown to significantly stabilizes blood sugar levels, so diabetics can definitely benefit from taking this supplement. Diabetics can also benefit greatly from any reduction in weight that may occur from taking green coffee bean extract, as well.</p>
<p>
That is only one of the reasons that this research is so exciting. According to studies published in the Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity Journal, green coffee bean extract may just be the first weight reduction product ever that actually delivers on its promises.</p>

        <article class="col-xs-8">
          <p>In a study recently published in the LA Times, participants were supplemented with green coffee bean and strictly monitored for 12 weeks. On average, the participants lost 17 lbs each. That's 16% of their overall body fat and 10.5% body weight. But that's not the most amazing part. What really got us excited is that these participants did not change anything in their daily routine or diet. Let me repeat that - the people in this study lost 17 pounds without any additional diet or exercise. The full results of this study can be found by <a href="#">clicking here</a>.</p>

          <p>

To date, green coffee beans are probably the most effective weapon for weight loss and combating obesity. You will not find a more effective solution to weight gain, hands down.</p>

          <p class="col-xs-12"><b>Green Coffee Bean Max  stands above other products on the market.</b> Most products on the market get their extract from a different source than that of the clinical studies. They do this to cut down on costs, but at the same time, it cuts down on effectiveness. In addition, they don't give the correct dose. By having a cheaper more inferior product, customers need to buy more in order to have the same results. If they see small weight loss, they buy more of it. It might be good business, but poor practice</p>
