                        <p><b>(Women’s Health)</b> - The <a href="#">Garcinia Cambogia</a> is the latest buzz in the “battle of the bulge”. With millions of people praising this so called “miracle pill” that you take as a supplement to lose weight, it has been getting a lot of attention since it was recently featured on The Dr. Oz Show. Surprisingly, many people who struggle daily with their weight have yet to hear about this powerful option. Those that have heard of the Garcinia Cambogia diet are confused about what it is, how to use it and how to avoid falling for ineffective formulas and downright scams. </p>
                        
                    <p>According to Dr Chen (The guest host on the popular Dr Oz show) <a href="#">Garcinia Cambogia</a> works in more than one way, “The first way is it goes in and causes the body to burn glucose, or sugar, and burn fat, mainly in the liver…The second way, the most important way, is it slows the release of sugar into the blood stream. So when you don’t have sugar building up in the blood stream, you don’t have fat building up because sugar turns to fat…When the two are combined together, you get this synergistic effect that basically burns and blocks and stops fat, but it also is natural and safe.”</p>

                        <p>Well, we here at WomensHealth were a little skeptical of this <a href="#">Garcinia Cambogia</a>. Even after pouring though mountains of research. While I had an educated opinion, I still had no personal proof that the <a href="#"> Garcinia Cambogia </a> option was worth the time. So, with my editors blessing, I decided to go out and put the product to the test myself. What better way to find out the truth that to conduct my own study?</p>

                        <p>To get started, I volunteered to be the guinea pig. I applied online for 5 bottles of Pure Garcinia Cambogia. <a href="#">Pure Garcinia Cambogia </a> is one of the most credible and trustworthy diet supplement suppliers on the market. It included a 100% Money Back Gurantee of the product and it did not try to fool me into agreeing to additional hidden offers. Another reason why I chose <a href="#">Pure Garcinia Cambogia </a> is because it is the most concentrated and purest Garcinia Cambogia on the market. This would give me the most accurate results for my test.</p>

                        <p><b>Here is what <a href="#">Pure Garcinia Cambogia </a>™ claimed on their website…</b></p>

                        <p>In a study published in the journal Lipids in Health &amp; Disease, subjects taking Pure Garcinia Cambogia lost an average of <b>19.3 pounds in 28 days</b> without diet or exercise.
Pure Garcinia Cambogia contains no stimulants.
Pure Garcinia Cambogia has been found to increase metabolism, boosting weight loss by more than 800%.
Studies have shown a 39% reduction in cholesterol and an <b>average 2 inch reduction in belly fat within 28 days.</b>

<br><b>Putting the Pure Garcinia Cambogia to the Test</b>
</p>

<p><a href="#">Pure Garcinia Cambogia</a> arrived within 4 days of having placed my order online.</p>

<p>The bottles I received held a month’s worth of pills which worked out perfect as I was to follow the supplement routine for 9 weeks time and document my progress throughout</p>

                        <p><b>My Results</b></p>
                        <blockquote class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12">
                            <p><b>Week One</b></p>
                            <p>After one week on the diet I was surprised at the dramatic results. My energy level was up, and I wasn’t even hungry, an apparent side effect of the Pure Garcinia Cambogia which curbs the appetite.</p>
                        
                            <p>I honestly felt fantastic.</p>

                            <p>And I didn’t even change anything about my daily routine. On day 7 I got on the scale and couldn’t believe my eyes. I had lost 5 lbs. But I still wasn’t convinced as they say you lose a lot of water at the beginning of any diet. I wanted to wait and see the results in the upcoming weeks. But it sure was looking up! I now weighed under 140 lbs for the first time in years!</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Week Three</b></p>


                            <p>After three weeks, I started the week off with even more energy and was actually sleeping more soundly than before. I was no longer waking up during the night and tossing and turning because my body was actually able to relax (this is a result of getting rid of the toxins I think). Plus I still managed to lose another 7 lbs, putting me at an unbelievable 12 lbs of weight loss, in just 3 weeks.</p>

                            <p>I must admit that I’m starting to believe that this diet is more than just a gimmick</p>

                            <p><b>Week Four</b></p>


                            <p>After 4 weeks all my doubts and skepticism had absolutely vanished! I am down, 2 full dress sizes, after losing another 9 lbs. And I still have a ton of energy. Quite often, around the third week of other diets, you tend to run out of steam. But with the Pure Garcinia Cambogia my energy levels don’t dip, but remain steady throughout the day. I no longer need that cat nap around 3pm in the afternoon! And I am even noticing that my stomach is digesting food so much better. No bloating or embarrassing gas after I eat!</p>



                            <p><b>Week Nine</b></p>

                            <p>After the Ninth week, my final results were shocking. I lost an unbelievable 37 lbs of fat since starting the Pure Garcinia Cambogia diet! Actually everyone at WomensHealth is kicking themselves for not having volunteered to be the guinea pig. Using the Pure Garcinia Cambogia in the last five weeks I lost 16 more lbs. To be honest I really don’t have much more than that left to lose, I’ve never looked sexier! And I am definitely going to continue taking the Pure Garcinia Cambogia afterwards because it has so many antioxidants and vitamins that makes my skin look unbelievable. It even worked better than Green Coffee!</p>



                            <p>“I couldn’t be any happier with the results. <br>
I Lost 37 lbs body fat in 9 Weeks, No Special Diet, No Intense Exercise”</p>
                            <br>
                        </blockquote>

            
                        <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Like us, here at WomensHealth, you might be a little doubtful about the effects of this diet, but you need to try it for yourself; the results are real. After conducting our own personal study we are pleased to see that people really are finding success with it (myself included ). And you have nothing to lose. Follow the links to order your Pure Garcinia Cambogia I have provided and know that you are getting a quality product that works; no strings attached! Works even better than Green Coffee.</p>

                        <p>Good Luck with your weight loss.</p>
