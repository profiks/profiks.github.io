                            <h5>Oprah and Other Celebrities Lose 4 lbs / Week of Belly Fat With This Secret That Our Readers Can Try Now!</h5>
                        </hgroup>

                        <p>(The Doctors) - The Pure White Kidney Bean Extract is the latest buzz in the "battle of the bulge". With millions of people praising this so called "miracle pill" that you take as a supplement to lose weight, it has been getting a lot of attention since it was recently featured on The Dr. Oz Show. Surprisingly, many people who struggle daily with their weight have yet to hear about this powerful option. Those that have heard of the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract diet are confused about what it is, how to use it and how to avoid falling for ineffective formulas and downright scams.</p>

                        <p>According to Dr Travis Stork, Pure White Kidney Bean Extract works in more than one way, "This revolutionary carb blocker works in an amazing way; as you eat, the food reaches your stomach, you digest it. However, when there is sugar in the form of starch - bread, pasta, potato, etc, the intestinal tract enzymes will break down the sugar (starch - bread, pasta, potato, etc) and dissolves the sugar instantly into your bloodstream causing weight gain and ups and downs in your levels. Now, when you take White Kidney Bean Extract, it paralyzes those enzymes in the intestinal system without being broken down into sugar." </p>

            <p>Well, we here on the Doctors were a little skeptical of this <a href="#">Pure White Kidney Bean Extract</a>. Even after pouring though mountains of research. While I had an educated opinion, I still had no personal proof that the <a href="#">Pure White Kidney Bean Extract</a> option was worth the time. So, with my editors blessing, I decided to go out and put the product to the test myself. What better way to find out the truth that to conduct my own study?</p>

              <p>To get started, I volunteered to be the guinea pig. I applied online for a bottle of Pure White Kidney Bean Extract. Pure White Kidney Bean Extract is one of the most credible and trustworthy diet supplement suppliers on the market. It included a 100% Money Back Guarantee of the product and it did not try to fool me into agreeing to additional hidden offers. Another reason why I chose Pure White Kidney Bean Extract is because it is the most concentrated and purest Pure White Kidney Bean Extract on the market. This would give me the most accurate results for my test.</p>

<p>"I lost 17lbs in 4 weeks with No Special Diet, No Intense Exercise!"</p>

<p>The benefits of the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract beat all of our initial skepticism. We found the diet not only helped with weight loss and getting rid of belly fat, but it seemed to boost energy levels, and also helped Oprah sleep better and to wake-up more rested.</p>

                      <h3 id="my-results">my results</h3>

                      <h3>Week One</h3>

                      <p>After one week on the diet I was surprised at the dramatic results. My energy level was up, and I wasn’t even hungry, an apparent side effect of the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract which curbs the appetite.</p>

            <p> I honestly felt fantastic.</p>

            <p>And I didn’t even change anything about my daily routine. On day 7 I got on the scale and couldn’t believe my eyes. I had lost 8 lbs. But I still wasn’t convinced as they say you lose a lot of water at the beginning of any diet. I wanted to wait and see the results in the upcoming weeks. But it sure was looking up! I now weighed under 150 lbs for the first time in years!</p>


                <h3>Week three</h3>

                <p>After three weeks, I started the week off with even more energy and was actually sleeping more soundly than before. I was no longer waking up during the night and tossing and turning because my body was actually able to relax (this is a result of getting rid of the toxins I think, a great benefit of the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract). Plus I still managed to lose another 5 lbs, putting me at an unbelievable 13 lbs of weight loss, in just 3 weeks. </p>

<p>I must admit that I’m starting to believe that this diet is more than just a gimmick.</p>


            
            <h3>Week four</h3>

            <p>After 4 weeks all my doubts and skepticism had absolutely vanished! I am down, 2 full dress sizes, after losing another 3 lbs. And I still have a ton of energy. Quite often, around the third week of other diets, you tend to run out of steam. But with the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract my energy levels don’t dip, but remain steady throughout the day. I no longer need that cat nap around 3pm in the afternoon! And I am even noticing that my stomach is digesting food so much better as a result of the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract supplement. No more bloating or embarrassing gas </p>

            <h3>Week nine</h3>

            <p>After the Ninth week, my final results were shocking. I lost an unbelievable 36 lbs of fat since starting the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract diet! Actually everyone on the Doctors is kicking themselves for not having volunteered to be the guinea pig. Using the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract in the last five weeks I lost 21 more lbs. To be honest I really don’t have much more left to lose, and I’ve never looked sexier! I am definitely going to continue taking the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract afterwards because it has so many antioxidants and vitamins that makes my skin look unbelievable. It even worked better than Green Coffee and Garcinia Cambogia! <br>
“I couldn’t be any happier with the results. <br>
I Lost 36 lbs body fat in 9 Weeks, No Special Diet, No Intense Exercise”</p>
