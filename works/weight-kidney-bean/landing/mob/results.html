My energy level was up, and I wasn’t even hungry, an apparent side effect of the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract which curbs the appetite. I honestly felt fantastic.<br>And I didn’t even change anything about my daily routine. On day 7 I got on the scale and couldn’t believe my eyes. I had lost 8 lbs. But I still wasn’t convinced as they say you lose a lot of water at the beginning of any diet. I wanted to wait and see the results in the upcoming weeks. But it sure was looking up! I now weighed under 150 lbs for the first time in years!</p></section><section id="week-three"><hgroup class="result-hd"><h3>Week three</h3></hgroup><p>After three weeks, I started the week off with even more energy and was actually sleeping more soundly than before. I was no longer waking up during the night and tossing and turning because my body was actually able to relax (this is a result of getting rid of the toxins I think, a great benefit of the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract). Plus I still managed to lose another 5 lbs, putting me at an unbelievable 13 lbs of weight loss, in just 3 weeks.</p><p>I must admit that I’m starting to believe that this diet is more than just a gimmick.</p></section><section id="week-four"><hgroup class="result-hd"><h3>Week four</h3></hgroup><p>After 4 weeks all my doubts and skepticism had absolutely vanished! I am down, 2 full dress sizes, after losing another 3 lbs. And I still have a ton of energy. Quite often, around the third week of other diets, you tend to run out of steam. But with the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract my energy levels don’t dip, but remain steady throughout the day. I no longer need that cat nap around 3pm in the afternoon! And I am even noticing that my stomach is digesting food so much better as a result of the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract supplement. No more bloating or embarrassing gas after I eat!</p></section><section id="week-nine"><hgroup class="result-hd"><h3>Week nine</h3></hgroup><p>After the Ninth week, my final results were shocking. I lost an unbelievable 36 lbs of fat since starting the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract diet! Actually everyone on the Doctors is kicking themselves for not having volunteered to be the guinea pig. Using the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract in the last five weeks I lost 21 more lbs. To be honest I really don’t have much more left to lose, and I’ve never looked sexier! I am definitely going to continue taking the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract afterwards because it has so many antioxidants and vitamins that makes my skin look unbelievable. It even worked better than Green Coffee and Garcinia Cambogia!<br>“I couldn’t be any happier with the results.<br>I Lost 36 lbs body fat in 9 Weeks, No Special Diet, No Intense Exercise”</p></section><section id="conclusions"><p><span class="underscore">Conclusion:</span> Like us, here on the Doctors, you might be a little doubtful about the effects of this diet, but you need to try it for yourself; the results are real.
