With millions of people praising this so called "miracle pill" that you take as a supplement to lose weight, it has been getting a lot of attention since it was recently featured on The Dr. Oz Show. Surprisingly, many people who struggle daily with their weight have yet to hear about this powerful option. Those that have heard of the Pure White Kidney Bean Extract diet are confused about what it is, how to use it and how to avoid falling for ineffective formulas and downright scams.<br>According to Dr Travis Stork, Pure White Kidney Bean Extract works in more than one way, "This revolutionary carb blocker works in an amazing way; as you eat, the food reaches your stomach, you digest it. However, when there is sugar in the form of starch - bread, pasta, potato, etc, the intestinal tract enzymes will break down the sugar (starch - bread, pasta, potato, etc) and dissolves the sugar instantly into your bloodstream causing weight gain and ups and downs in your levels. Now, when you take White Kidney Bean Extract, it paralyzes those enzymes in the intestinal system without being broken down into sugar."</p></article></div><script src="js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script><script src="js/main.js"></script></div></body></html>
